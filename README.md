# ColdBrew
“Caffeinated Conciseness. Industrial safety.”

ColdBrew is a high-performance, hybrid-typed programming language that compiles to human-readable JavaScript and TypeScript. It leverages the minimalist syntax of CoffeeScript while incorporating the rigorous type safety of modern TypeScript.

## Core Philosophy
ColdBrew is built on three fundamental principles:
1. Readability Over Ritual: Code should focus on logic, not punctuation. Significant whitespace replaces curly braces and semicolons.
2. Implicit Safety: The compiler uses advanced flow analysis to provide type safety without requiring the developer to write verbose type annotations.
3. Bilingual Nature: It operates as a dynamic language during rapid prototyping and transitions into a strictly typed language for production.

## Key Features

### Hybrid Type System
ColdBrew allows developers to choose their level of strictness. By default, the language is statically typed through inference. However, developers can opt into dynamic typing using the dyn keyword or enforce strict contracts using explicit annotations.
Zero-Config Interoperability
ColdBrew is designed to exist within the existing JavaScript ecosystem.
- Import JS/TS: Use any NPM package natively.
- Export JS/TS: Compiled output is standard ECMAScript or TypeScript, ensuring compatibility with all modern build tools (Vite, Webpack, Bun).
Enhanced Syntax
- Significant Whitespace: Eliminates visual clutter.
- Expression-Based: Almost every structure in ColdBrew returns a value.
- Built-in Pattern Matching: A modern replacement for complex switch-case statements.
